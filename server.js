/**
 * Created by verangasamy on 7/29/14.
 * Microservice follows the Scale Cube (specifically y-axis scaling) pattern and  functionally
 * decompose the application into a set of collaborating services. Each service implements a set of narrowly,
 * related functions. For example, an application might consist of services such as the order management service,
 * the customer management service etc.
 * Service communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST and run in different ports .
 * Services are developed and deployed independently of one another.
